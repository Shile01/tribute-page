      Stephen William Hawking was born January 8, 1942, Oxford, Oxfordshire,
      England. He died March 14, 2018, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire.<br />
      Stephen was an english theoretical physicist,cosmotologist whose theory of
      exploding black holes drew upon both relativity theory and quantum
      mechanics. He also worked with space-time singularities and at the same
      time was an author at
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Theoretical_Cosmology"
        >Center for Theoretical Cosmology</a
      >
      University of Cambridge.

      Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford in
      October 1959 at the age of 17, where he received a first-class BA (Hons.)
      degree in physics. He began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge
      in October 1962, where he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics
      and theoretical physics, specializing in general relativity and cosmology
      in March 1966.

      In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form
      of motor neurone disease (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. After the
      loss of his speech, he was able to communicate through a speech-generating
      deviceâ€”initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using
      a single cheek muscle attached to a sensor.Through the program, and the
      help of assistants, Hawking continued to write at a prolific rate. His
      work included numerous scientific papers, of course, but also information
      for the non-scientific community.

        In 2007, at the age of 65, Hawking made an important step toward space travel. While visiting the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, he was given the opportunity to experience an environment without gravity.

        He said;
        <blockquote>"The zero-G part was wonderful, and the high-G part was no problem. I could have gone on and on. Space, here I come!"</blockquote>

        <h3>Quotes by Stephen Hawking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and hold on to that childlike wonder about what makes the universe exist.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Intelligence is the ability to adapt.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It is all right to make mistakes; nothing is perfect because with perfection, we would not exist.</li>
            <br>
            <li>However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do to succeed at.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
